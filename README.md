I. Introduction

The objective of this project is to build a responsive minimal viable web app that serves as a no-code machine learning platform. 

II. Goals & Objectives 

Problem Statement 

Currently, healthcare technology companies do not make data driven regulatory decisions to introduce new medical devices, and therapies to market. Although companies may have data of their own devices, they do not have a simple way to leverage data of real-word evidence of their own devices, and other substantially equivalent devices in the market to support regulatory and business decision making. 

Proposed Solution

As a potential solution, this project will focus on building a web application that will serve as a machine learning platform for text analysis. We will train our machine learning models by using FDAâ€™s open source data to classify text provided by the user.  This web app will allow our users to easily get actionable data, and insight from the raw text/data obtained from the FDA website (https://open.fda.gov/). FDA has some of the world's most valuable data stores about human health and medicine publicly available on its website.  There  is a machine learning service with trained models that the app will be integrated with as part of a bigger application. 



III. Target Audience 

Our target audience are healthcare technology leaders, entrepreneurs, and industry-specific regulatory stakeholders. 

IV. Core/Key Features
Please see wireframes.pdf to see design/prototype. 

1)Landing Page:
This gives users information about the platform, and our product 
It will include a button to sign-up or login to our dashboard  

2)Sign-Up Page 

3) Login Authentication 

4) Dashboard Listing Trained Classification Models

5) Machine Learning Model Page: 
This will be templatized in the future to access more trained models  
This page will be where the user will see details about a selected model and test the model live.
